    "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the ingenuity and layered infrastructure of traditional neural networks with graph data to derive insights from the relationships between different nodes and their connections. These networks operate either at a graph-level (producing a single embedding representative of the whole graph), a node-level (classifying/embedding individual nodes), or an edge-level (predicting relational properties). Depending on the intended purpose of a model and its given task, each level will garner a specific subset of information to learn from and derive unique insights. Harnessing the relational structure of this unique NN, each layer following the initial input embedding will aggregate information from neighboring nodes, allowing GNNs to better understand global graph topology and hierarchical data structuring. In order to combat the violation of sample independence in many-real world datasets, GNNs outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in capturing relational dependencies in datasets across several domains like NLP, computer vision, social networks, and molecular biology.\n",

    "In our demonstration, GNNs will be applied in the realm of molecular biology, specifically predicting a molecule's ability to permeate the Blood-Brain barrier based on its chemical structure. This binary classification task pairs incredibly well with the capabilities of GNNs as its fundamental processes directly apply to understanding the relational structures of graphed molecules in the central nervous system. Given the great physical variation of these molecular structures, the amount of chemical dependence upon neighboring chemicals, and pure expense of lab equipment in real-time analysis, GNNs offer accurate predictions with a fraction of a pharmaceutical lab's cost.\n",
